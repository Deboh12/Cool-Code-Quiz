## Description
Cool Code Quiz is a web-based quiz application designed to test users' knowledge of JavaScript. The motivation behind this project was to create an engaging and interactive way for individuals to assess their understanding of JavaScript concepts. The project was developed not only as a practical exercise but also to provide an educational resource for those learning JavaScript.

The main problem it solves is making the process of learning and testing JavaScript concepts more enjoyable and challenging. By gamifying the learning experience, users can reinforce their knowledge in a fun and interactive way.

Throughout the development of Cool Code Quiz, key lessons were learned in creating dynamic and responsive web applications, handling user interactions, and integrating timers for time-based quizzes.
